Event Correlation DB Seminar

Big data is the term for a collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications. The challenges include capture, curation, storage, search, sharing, transfer, analysis, and visualization.

On the other hand, Event correlation is a technique for making sense of a large number of events and pinpointing the few events that are really important in that mass of information. Event correlation usually takes place inside one or several management platforms which comprises data from various sources.

In this paper, we combine these areas and try to conclude interesting insights. The data collected for analysis, is from an active website eventful.com and has over 2.5 million records. The field chosen for analysis in this paper is "Music".

*This paper was prototyped for two ideas: Planner and Association Rules. Of these, only Planner (which is my original work) has been committed here. However, the documentation report explains both the ideas.
